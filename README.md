# SORN_Izhikevich_group

First, I replicate the spiking neural network from Lazar et al. (2009) 'SORN: a self-organizing recurrent neural network.' Then, I identify neuronal groups using the algorithm from Izhikevich et al. (2004) 'Spike-timing Dynamics of Neuronal Groups.' This helps find repeating spike sequences in the neural network using its intrinsic synaptic weights.
